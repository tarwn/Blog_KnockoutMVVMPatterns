Example Warehouse Managament System

Initially I started building this to serve as sample code for a blog post on how to manage duplicated validation logic for an application with different front-end and back-end languages. But as I put togetehr the example, I realised I was building enough of a system that I could also use it to show some other techniques. 

Other Potential Blog Posts:

- API Tests to ensure authorization is in place
- Extremely simple setup for authentication
- Collecting Unhandled JS Errors
- Retry of AJAX commands for flaky networks - extra value of using promise architecture
- ETag processing using IHttpActionResult
- setting up jshint


Next Steps:

X Authentication/Login form
- basic CSS
- basic JS Unit Tests
- basic C# unit Tests
X C# Tests for endpoint authorization
- validation that user can perform action
- validation of incoming objects (is this a valid order)
- cross validation with UI for user authorization
